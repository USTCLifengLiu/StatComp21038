# StatComp21038
URL: http://github.com/USTCLifengLiu/StatComp21038 This contains a R package for Bayesian Lasso Regression.
This R package mainly contains a R function BayesianLasso (in order to solve the Bayesian Lasso Regression problem) Bayespredmse (in order to estimate the prediction or MSE) and some C++ functions such as sumC, loglikeli, EmpiricalBayes and HyperpriorBayes in order to make the BayesianLasso function faster.
